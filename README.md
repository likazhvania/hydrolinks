HydroThreads: Curved Connections from Water to City

Curving “direct” lines from waterways to buildings to explore a different sense of accessibility—how water threads through a city and reaches us.

Built with OpenStreetMap data in QGIS, using a short PyQGIS script to connect building centroids to their nearest water segment, then a Geometry Generator expression to gently curve those lines for a more organic, legible map.
